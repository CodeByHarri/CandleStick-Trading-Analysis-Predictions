# Stock Prediction Using Feature Creation & Machine Learning

## Objective 

*This project aims to accurately predict if a selected stock will increase or decrease in price for a selected time lag using feature creation and machine learning methods. This object will be broken down into **5 stages*** 

## Methadology 

### 1. **STAGE 1: A Simple Stock Predictor [COMPLETE]** 
    
This simple stock predictor will give a binary 1 or 0 to determine if a stock will go up or down for a certain time lag. Notebook *S1_Simple_Stock_Predictor* undergoes some simple feature creation for the SP500 with lag 1 aiming to predict if the next day the SP500 will go up or down. It uses LightGBM and Optuna for tunning. 
    
    
### 2. **STAGE 2: Feature Rich Stock Predictor [WIP]**

In stage 2 the goal is to add both technical and non-technical features to the data in order to simulate trading ideas and strategies. Features ideas include *value-investing*, *technical analysis* & *sentiment analysis* type features .
